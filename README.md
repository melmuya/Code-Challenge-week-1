## Project Description
This Repo contains 3 tools
1. A Grade Calculator
A program that prompts the user to input student marks between 0 and 100 then outputs the correct grade: 

A > 79, B - 60 to 79, C -  59 to 49, D - 40 to 49, E - less 40.

2. A Speed Detector
This is a program that takes as input the speed of a car, and prints “Ok” if the speed is less than 70. Otherwise, for every 5 km/h above the speed limit (70), it gives the driver one demerit point and prints the total number of demerit points. If the driver gets more than 12 points however, it prints “License suspended”.

3. A Net Salary Calculator
This is a program whose major task is to calculate an individual’s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits. It then displays both gross salary and net salary.
